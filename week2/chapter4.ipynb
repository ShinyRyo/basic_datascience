4.1 概要と事前準備\n","\n","キーワード：Numpy、Scipy、Pandas\n","\n","この章ではPandasを使ったデータ加工処理について、もう少し詳しく学んでいきます。Pandasは2章で学んだように、ある条件を満たすデータを抽出したり、操作したりするなど、さまざまな機能があります。\n","\n","たとえば、全国の小学校で同じ算数のテストを実施したケースを考えてみます。\n","それぞれの都道府県の最高点取得者だけを抜き出したいこともあるでしょうし、それぞれの都道府県の平均点を出したいこともあるでしょう。このように、さまざまな集計軸があります。さらに、都道府県×学校×クラスの3軸で平均値を算出したい場合や、さらに男女で計算したい場合など、軸が複数になっているケースもあります。Pandasを使えば、そのような集計をすることもできます。また、他のデータ（たとえば、国語の試験結果）とつなげたいときも、キー（各学生に与えられた一意となるデータなど）があれば、結合して1つの`DataFrame`オブジェクトにして、まとめて処理できます。\n","\n","そのほか、時系列データを扱うときもPandasは役に立ちます。\n","たとえば、ある店舗の日時の売上推移データを取り扱うときに、1週間や1か月ごとの平均値の推移を簡単に計算することができます。これらのプログラムをいちから記述するとなると大変ですが、Pandasではこのような計算も1～2行ほどのコードを書くだけで実行できます。さらに、データに欠損値や何か異常値が入っているとき、それらを何らかの方法で一括処理したい場合にも使えます。\n","\n","もちろん、これらの処理は自分でいちからPythonのプログラムを書くことで対応できますが、実装するのに時間がかかります。それに比べてPandasの機能を使えば、簡単に操作できます。また、 機械学習のモデルを構築するときは、そのアルゴリズムが使えるようにデータを前処理する必要があります。たとえば、縦に並んでいたデータのカラムを横に並べたい場面などもあり、そういった操作もPandasなら簡単にできます。\n","\n","上記のようなデータ操作をする場合、SQLやエクセルのピボットテーブルなどを使っても処理できますが、Pythonのプログラムだけで一貫してコーディングしたい場合はPandasを使うと便利です。\n","なおPandasには、グラフの描画機能もあり、ハンドリングしたデータをグラフとしてすぐに描画できます。"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"anXWID3-8fnB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###
